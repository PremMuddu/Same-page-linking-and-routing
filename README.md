# Same-page-linking-and-routing
## 

Description: A single page application that leverages routing between pages without refreshing the page. The router never needs to go to a server after the page is initially loaded which improves the web page loading time. 


Run: Download files, run a http server, open up the developer tools and click on each link on the navigation bar to watch the page load dynamically without a delay.
